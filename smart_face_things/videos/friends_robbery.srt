1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,585
This is the unit for you,
my friend.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,547
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage compartments.

3
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:09,009
Some big enough
to fit a grown man.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,552
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,721
I got in there myself once.

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,223
My roommate bet me five bucks
that I couldn't

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,100
and then he stuck a board
through the handles

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,644
and locked me in. Yeah.

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,523
It was funny till I started
feeling like I was in a coffin.

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,277
No, you...you can't fit
in that thing.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,653
That's not deep enough.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,904
Oh, yeah?

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,616
If I can't..

14
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,786
...I'll knock five bucks
off the price of the unit.

15
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,996
Alright, you have
yourself a deal.

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,414
Okay.

17
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,212
'See? I told you.'

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,635
'Sometimes, I come in here
just to get away from it.'

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,472
'Hey, a nickel!'

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,150
Oh, my God!

21
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,862
(Joey)
'What?'

22
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,950
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,370
What happened?

24
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,875
Aw, man. He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

25
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,877
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in?

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,005
And where the hell
is all of our stuff?

27
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,924
Well, this guy came by
to look at the unit

28
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,550
and, and he said he
didn't think it was big enough

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,803
to fit a grown man.

30
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,305
So...you got in
voluntarily?

31
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,308
I was tryingÂ 
to make a sale!

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,810
Oh, man,
if I ever run

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,937
into that guy again,
y-you know what I'm gonna do?

34
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,313
Bend over?
