## Get Frames

This step requires the ffmpeg command. If it's not installed, please do so first.

To get the frames for a video of your choice, do the following:

- `sudo chmod +x ./store_frames.sh` (to allow permission to run the script)
- `./store_frames.sh path/to/video` (where the "path to video" is replaced by the absolute or relative path to the video file to process)
